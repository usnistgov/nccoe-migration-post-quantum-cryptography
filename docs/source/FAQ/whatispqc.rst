What is Post-Quantum Cryptography \(PQC\)?
***********************


Post-Quantum Cryptography \(PQC\) refers to cryptographic methods designed to resist attacks from both classical and quantum computers. 
As quantum computers advance, they could potentially break current encryption methods like RSA and elliptic curve cryptography \(ECC\), which rely on mathematical problems that are difficult for classical computers to solve.
The aim of PQC is to develop encryption algorithms that remain secure against these emerging threats while still being compatible with existing systems and networks.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology \(NIST\) is leading global efforts to standardize these quantum-resistant algorithms to ensure the security of digital communications in the quantum era.
