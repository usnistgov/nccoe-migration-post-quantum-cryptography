What U.S. government policies, memorandums, and standards discuss migration to PQC? 
***********************

The U.S. government’s approach to migrating to PQC is designed to safeguard national security and critical infrastructure against future quantum threats.  

The following bullets offer a timeline that illustrates the directives and resources which were established for use by federal agencies:


*   January 2022, `National Security Memorandum-8 \(NSM-8\) <https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/01/19/memorandum-on-improving-the-cybersecurity-of-national-security-department-of-defense-and-intelligence-community-systems/>`_  

    *   NSM-8 provides guidance for National Security System \(NSS\) and related assets that outlines updating the Commercial National Security Algorithm \(CNSA\) to include quantum-resistant protocols, additional protections for data, migration efforts, and reporting requirements.

*   May 2022, `National Security Memorandum-10 \(NSM-10\) <https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/04/national-security-memorandum-on-promoting-united-states-leadership-in-quantum-computing-while-mitigating-risks-to-vulnerable-cryptographic-systems/>`_ 

    *   NSM-10 provides guidance for non-NSS and related assets which outlines the creation of cryptographic migration efforts with NIST NCCoE, the Federal Civilian Executive Branch \(FCEB\) annual cryptographic inventory of High Value Assets and High Impact Systems reported to CISA, migration efforts and reporting away from Cryptanalytically Relevant Quantum Computer \(CRQC\) vulnerable cryptography.

*   September 2022, `Announcing the Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite 2.0 \(CNSA 2.0\) <https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/News-Highlights/Article/Article/3148990/nsa-releases-future-quantum-resistant-qr-algorithm-requirements-for-national-se/>`_

    *   Release of CNSA 2.0 provides guidance for quantum-resistant algorithms \(QRAs\), timelines, and additional guidance sources for NSS and related assets. FAQ page was updated Dec 2024.

*   November 2022, `Office of Management and Budget M-23-02 <https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/M-23-02-M-Memo-on-Migrating-to-Post-Quantum-Cryptography.pdf>`_

    *   M-23-02 provides direction for agencies to comply with NSM-10 and further defines what systems/assets and associated information to include in inventories. NIST will establish a mechanism to enable the exchange of PQC testing information and best practices. That mechanism is the `NCCoE Migration to PQC project <https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/crypto-agility-considerations-migrating-post-quantum-cryptographic-algorithms>`_. 

*   December 2022, `Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Act 6 U.S.C. § 1526 <https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ260/PLAW-117publ260.pdf>`_

    *   The Quantum Computer Cybersecurity Preparedness Act reaffirms NSM-10 and M-23-02. It includes requirements for inventory of cryptographic systems, migration to PQC, and reporting in alignment with prior PQC memorandums.

*   August 2024, `The Secretary of Commerce approved three Federal Information Processing Standards \(FIPS\) for post-quantum cryptography <https://csrc.nist.gov/news/2024/postquantum-cryptography-fips-approved>`_   

    *   `FIPS 203: ML-KEM \(Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism Standard\)	<https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final>`_

    *   `FIPS 204: ML-DSA \(Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Standard\) <https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final>`_

    *   `FIPS 205: SLH-DSA \(Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Standard) <https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/205/final>`_

*	October 2024, `NIST Announces 14 Candidates to Advance to the Second Round of the Additional Digital Signatures for the Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process <https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2024/pqc-digital-signature-second-round-announcement>`_ 

*	November 2024, `Transition to Post-Quantum Cryptography Standards | Draft NIST IR 8547 is Available for Comment	<https://csrc.nist.gov/news/2024/draft-nist-ir-8547-is-available-for-comment>`_

*	December 2024, *Updated* `The Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite 2.0 and Quantum Computing FAQ <https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/07/2003071836/-1/-1/1/CSI_CNSA_2.0_FAQ_.PDF>`_ 

*	March 2025, `NIST Selects HQC as Fifth Algorithm for Post-Quantum Encryption <https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2025/03/nist-selects-hqc-fifth-algorithm-post-quantum-encryption>`_
