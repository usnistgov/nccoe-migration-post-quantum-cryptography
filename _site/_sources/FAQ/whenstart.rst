Where can you start your migration to PQC?
***********************

A good place to start your migration to PQC is to perform cryptographic asset discovery and inventory on your systems.
Knowing the extent, location, and use of the current cryptography that you have employed will allow you to understand what needs to be migrated.
 
**Additional Resources:** Some example publications go into further detail on how to perform migration:
