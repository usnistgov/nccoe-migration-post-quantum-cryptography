What are some other terms used to describe post-quantum cryptography?
***********************

With the growing attention on quantum computing as an emerging technology, compounding the term "quantum" with "readiness", "resistant". "safe", or "secure" has become another way to convey what is being achieved in this cryptographic migration.

What are some examples of the use of “quantum-readiness” to describe what is being achieved by migrating to post-quantum cryptography?
