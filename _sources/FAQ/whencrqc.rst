When will a cryptanalytically relevant quantum computer exist?
***********************

Estimates for the development of a cryptanalytically relevant quantum computer \(CRQC\) vary widely:

*	**Near-term**: Some believe that CRQCs may emerge by 2030, driven by rapid advancements.
*	**Mid-term**: Many anticipate they could become feasible within 15 to 20 years, requiring significant progress in scaling and error correction.
*	**Long-term**: Others believe it may take 30+ years due to the challenges of achieving fault-tolerant quantum systems.

Despite uncertainty in when a CRQC will come into existence, experts agree on the importance of preparing for quantum threats now to secure cryptographic systems for the future.
