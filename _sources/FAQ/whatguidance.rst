What does NIST guidance say about transitioning from quantum-vulnerable cryptographic algorithms to post-quantum digital signature algorithms and key-establishment schemes?
***********************


`NIST IR 8547 \(Initial Public Draft\) Transition to Post-Quantum Cryptography Standards <https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8547.ipd>`_ 
identifies existing quantum-vulnerable cryptographic standards and the current quantum-resistant standards that will be used in the migration.
This report should inform the efforts and timelines of federal agencies, industry, and standards organizations for migrating information technology products, services, and infrastructure to PQC.
Comments received on this draft will be used to revise this transition plan and feed into other algorithm-specific and application-specific guidance for the transition to PQC.

The following questions are addressed in NIST IR 8547:

*   Where are the quantum-vulnerable algorithms in NISTâ€™s existing cryptographic standards as well as the post-quantum algorithm standards that have been recently published?
    
    *   See section 2 of `NIST IR 8457 <https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2024/NIST.IR.8547.ipd.pdf>`_

*   What are some migration considerations and use cases?
  
    *   See section 3 of `NIST IR 8457 <https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2024/NIST.IR.8547.ipd.pdf>`_

*   What is the transition plan for quantum-vulnerable algorithms?
   
    *   See Section 4.1 of `NIST IR 8457 <https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2024/NIST.IR.8547.ipd.pdf>`_

*   What are the post-quantum security categories?

    *   See Table 1 of `NIST IR 8457 <https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2024/NIST.IR.8547.ipd.pdf>`_

*   What are the quantum-vulnerable digital signature algorithms?

    *   See Table 2 of `NIST IR 8457 <https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2024/NIST.IR.8547.ipd.pdf>`_

*   What are the post-quantum digital signature algorithms?

    *   See Table 3 of `NIST IR 8457 <https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2024/NIST.IR.8547.ipd.pdf>`_

*   What are the quantum-vulnerable key-establishment schemes?

    *   See Table 4 of `NIST IR 8457 <https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2024/NIST.IR.8547.ipd.pdf>`_

*   What are the post-quantum key-establishment schemes?

    *   See Table 5 of `NIST IR 8457 <https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2024/NIST.IR.8547.ipd.pdf>`_

*   What are security strength bit minimums for AES (FIPS 197)?

    *   See Table 6 of `NIST IR 8457 <https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2024/NIST.IR.8547.ipd.pdf>`_

*   What are the collision security strength, collision security categories, preimage security strength, and preimage security categories for hash functions and eXtendable-Output Functions (XOFs)?

    *   See Table 7 of `NIST IR 8457 <https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2024/NIST.IR.8547.ipd.pdf>`_
